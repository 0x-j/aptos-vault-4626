# Security Audit Update - Critical Issues Resolved

**Date:** 2025-01-08 (Updated)  
**Status:** ✅ **CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FIXED**  
**Risk Level:** 🟡 **MEDIUM RISK** *(Previously: 🔴 HIGH RISK)*

---

## ✅ CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES VERIFIED

### 1. **Dispatch Function Security Breach** → ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Fix**: Completely removed dispatch function registration from factory
- **Impact**: Eliminates security breach and runtime failure risks
- **Implementation**: Clean architecture with `ConstructorRef` return for external setup

### 2. **Withdraw Authorization Vulnerability** → ✅ **RESOLVED**  
- **Fix**: Added ownership validation with `object::is_owner()`
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized asset theft
- **Implementation**: 
  ```move
  assert!(object::is_owner(vault_store, sender_addr), ERR_NOT_STORE_OWNER);
  ```

### 3. **Additional Security Improvements**
- ✅ Added `ERR_NOT_STORE_OWNER: u64 = 6` error constant
- ✅ Ownership check added to `mint()` function (line 247)
- ✅ Ownership check added to `withdraw()` function (line 289)
- ✅ Changed to `create_sticky_object()` for better object management

## Remaining Non-Critical Issues

### ERC-4626 Compliance (Non-Security)
- Missing `receiver` parameters in deposit/mint functions
- Missing `owner` and `receiver` parameters in withdraw/redeem functions  
- Event schemas missing receiver/owner fields

### Technical Issues (Minor)
- State update timing in deposit function
- Empty vault edge case handling

## ✅ DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATION

**SECURITY STATUS: SAFE FOR DEPLOYMENT**

The vault contract is now **secure for testnet deployment** and can proceed with:

1. 🧪 **Comprehensive testing** on testnet
2. 📋 **ERC-4626 compliance improvements** for better interoperability
3. 🚀 **Mainnet deployment** after thorough testing

**Critical security vulnerabilities that previously blocked deployment have been completely resolved.**

---

## Conclusion

Excellent work on the security fixes! The contract has moved from **HIGH RISK** to **MEDIUM RISK** with all critical vulnerabilities resolved. The remaining issues are related to standard compliance and minor technical improvements, none of which pose security threats.

**The vault is now ready for testnet deployment and testing.**
